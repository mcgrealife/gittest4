# feature 3 - created on main branch; after creating 2 new feature branches

- if I checkout the feature will they contian this file?

  - I think no.
  - the working index should be associated with this master branch only right? testing now

- Interesting. this file remains in my working directory after chekcing out to feature2 branch

  - that is good for my current workflow, but unexpected

- well, what about changes to files? to they persist between checkouts?
